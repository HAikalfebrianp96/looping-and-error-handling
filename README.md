# Looping and Handling Error

## Looping
In this chapter, we’ll build a Guess the Number program. The computer will pick a 
random number between 1 and 20, and the user will have five attempts to guess the 
number. For every incorrect guess, the computer will let the user know if the correct 
answer is higher or lower than the user’s guess. If the user doesn’t guess the answer in 
five attempts, the program will tell the user what the number was.
To learn how to build a game like this, this chapter covers the following topics:
• User’s view of the game
• Loops
• while statement
• First loop in a real program
• Increment and decrement
• Running a program multiple times
• Python’s built-in packages
• Generating a random number
• Simulating flipping a coin
• Other examples of using random numbers
• Creating an infinite loop
• A new style of building a loop: while True and break
• Asking if the user wants to repeat: the empty string
• Pseudocode
• Building our Guess the Number program
• Playing a game multiple times
• Error checking with try/except
• continue statement
• Building error-checking utility functions
• Coding challenge

## Handling Error
exceptions can be handled using a try statement. The critical operation which can raise an exception is placed inside the try clause. The code that handles the exceptions is written in the except clause. We can thus choose what operations to perform once we have caught the exception


## Objective Statement
Get to know For Loop and While Loop.
Get to know Break, Continue, and Pass.
Get to know List Comprehension.
Get to know Handling Error and Exception.
Get to know Function and Return.

## Challenges
Requires accuracy to input data

## Expected Outcome
Know For Loop and While Loop.
Know Break, Continue, and Pass.
Know List Comprehension.
Know Handling Error and Exception.
Know Function and Return.

## For Loop
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

## While Loop
While loops repeat as long as a certain boolean condition is met (true).

## Else After For
The else function after for is a function that takes precedence over search loops - to provide a program exit when the search is not found.

## Else After While
The else clause only executes when your while condition becomes false. If you break out of the loop, or if an exception is raised, it won't be executed.

## Break
Break stops the loop then exits, followed by executing the statement after the loop block.

## Continue
The continue statement will stop the current iteration.

## Pass
In Python programming, the pass statement is null. Pass statements in Python are not ignored.

## List Comprehension
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

## Handling Error and Exception
Syntax Error: Syntax Error is a state where python code encounters a write error. The Python interpreter can detect this error while the code is executing

## Exception
Exception is a condition when the syntax is written correctly, but an error occurs because the syntax cannot be executed, but because of a mathematical error, an error in the name of the function, library, and others.

## Function
In Python, a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task. Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable. Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable.

## Return
The return statement is used to exit a function and go back to the place from where it was called.
